DGEclust is a program for clustering digital expression data, such as RNA-seq, CAGE and others.
It takes as input a table of count data and it estimates the number and characteristics of the 
clusters supported by the data. This is achieved using a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture 
Model built around the Negative Binomial Distribution for modelling over-dispersed count data,
combined with a blocked Gibbs sampler for efficient Bayesian learning in said model. 

This program is part of the software collection of the Computational Genomics Group at the University
of Bristol (http://bioinformatics.bris.ac.uk/) and it is still under heavy development. You can find 
a preview of the upcoming paper in which the method is explained on arXiv.org: http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4144.
