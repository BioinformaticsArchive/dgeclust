{"name":"DGEclust","tagline":"Hierarchical Non-Parametric Bayesian Clustering of Digital Expression Data","body":"DGEclust is a program for clustering digital expression data, such as RNA-seq, CAGE and others.\r\nIt takes as input a table of count data and it estimates the number and characteristics of the \r\nclusters supported by the data. This is achieved using a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture \r\nModel built around the Negative Binomial Distribution for modelling over-dispersed count data,\r\ncombined with a blocked Gibbs sampler for efficient Bayesian learning in said model. \r\n\r\nThis program is part of the software collection of the Computational Genomics Group at the University\r\nof Bristol (http://bioinformatics.bris.ac.uk/) and it is still under heavy development. You can find \r\ntechnical details on the statistical methodologies used internally by DGEclust in the following preprints: http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4144 and http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0723.   \r\n\r\nFor more information, send an email to Dimitris.Vavoulis@bristol.ac.uk or Julian.Gough@bristol.ac.uk\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
