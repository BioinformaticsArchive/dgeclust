Installation
========

Just download **DGEclust** using the links at the top of the page and unzip it 
in a directory of your choice. You can rename the unzipped directory to something 
more convenient, if you wish. That's it! No further installation procedure is 
necessary. In order to be able to use the software you will need a fairly recent 
version of the <a href="http://www.scipy.org/" target=”_blank”>Scipy</a> stack. 
**DGEclust** was developed and tested on a Mac, but it should be usable without 
problems on Linux machines, too.
